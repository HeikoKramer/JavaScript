# JavaScript Notes 2
Additional notes to my initial [note file](https://github.com/HeikoKramer/webDev/blob/main/javascript_notes.md) to document my learning progress on JavaScript. <br>
I'm taking Brad Traversy's [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://subscription.packtpub.com/video/web-development/9781789539509/p1) course on packthub.com while writing these notes. <br>

## Add JavaScript to your HTML file
There are two ways to JavaScript to a HTML file: <br>
<br>
**Add it via `<script>` tag** <br>

```html
<script>
  alert('Gude');
</script>
```

**Link to an file where the script is stored**

```html
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

## alert()
An alert will display the content you put in there on the screen. <br>

```js
// Display on screen
alert("Ei Gude!");
```
