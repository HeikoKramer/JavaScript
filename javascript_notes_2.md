# JavaScript Notes 2
Additional notes to my initial [note file](https://github.com/HeikoKramer/webDev/blob/main/javascript_notes.md) to document my learning progress on JavaScript. <br>
I'm taking Brad Traversy's [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://subscription.packtpub.com/video/web-development/9781789539509/p1) course on packthub.com while writing these notes. <br>
