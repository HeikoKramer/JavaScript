## How to install / run JavaScript
JavaScript is supported by and included in all standard web-browsers (except text-only browsers like lynx) <br>
An easy way to run and test JavaScript code is to include it into an **.html** file and open it in a browser. <br>
<br>
**Example:** <br>
Create the file **index.html** with the following content: <br>

```html
<script>
  console.log("hello world");
</script>
```

This file is a most basic **hello world** script, which will display those word in the debug console of you browser. <br>
Open the **index.html** in your browser, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd> to open the console (Firefox, Linux) and you should see **hello world** written in the console log. <br>
