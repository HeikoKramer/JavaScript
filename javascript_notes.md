## How to install / run JavaScript
JavaScript is supported by and included in all standard web-browsers (except text-only browsers like lynx) <br>
An easy way to run and test JavaScript code is to include it into an **.html** file and open it in a browser. <br>
<br>
**Example:** <br>
Create the file **index.html** with the following content: <br>

```html
<script>
  consol.log("hello world");
</script>
```
