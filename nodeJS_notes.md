# Node.js

This document contains my notes on **Node.js** – which are taken while following the [Node.js Tutorial](https://youtu.be/g3Tt8ZozKWU) series (German) from the *native web GmbH* on YouTube. <br>

### What is Node.js?
Node.js a JavaScript runtime for the server, build on Chrome's V8 JS-engine. <br>
It uses an event driven, non-blocking I/O model. <br>
**npm** – the **Node Package Manager** – is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world. <br>
### [Versioning](https://youtu.be/g3Tt8ZozKWU?list=PL6QrD7_cU23kaZ05MvixcoJ5vctRD1qgC&t=421)
The Node.js release-cycle looks as following: <br>
* new major-release every six months
  * **even** numbers (4.0, 6.0) are released in **April**
  * **odd** numbers (5.0, 7.0) are released in **October**

The current **even** version turns into the **LTS** version (long term support), when the next **odd** version is released. <br>
LTS versions are actively supported for 18 months and receive security updates for additional 12 months after that. <br>
<br>
**NOTE:** It is recommended (especially in an enterprise context), to use a valid LTS version. <br>
