# Tensorflow.js Notes
Created that notes to follow a **Tensorflow.js learning group** on @bekahhw's Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/bekahhw). <br>
The group's start was the 9th of November, it is supposed to be a 12-episodes series. <br>
The base for the group's learning path is the [Learning TensorFlow.js](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-tensorflowjs/9781492090786/) by Gant Laborde, published by O'Reilly. <br>
