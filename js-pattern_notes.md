# JavaScript Patterns

*This document is an extension to my [JavaScript Notes 2](https://github.com/HeikoKramer/webDev/blob/main/javascript_notes_2.md). <br>
I'm writing these notes while taking Brad Traversy's [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://subscription.packtpub.com/video/web-development/9781789539509/p1) course on packthub.com* 

## What are patterns?
**Patterns** are re-usable solutions to re-occurring problems, they are **programming templates**, a specific way to write code. <br>
The scope of patterns vary significantly, the *factory* and *prototype* patterns are used for object creation, the *module* pattern and its variations are used for overall structure, then you have software design patterns like *MVC* â€“ the *Module View Controller* pattern and these apply to whole applications or to just little blocks of code. <br>
<br>
Patterns we will have a look on are: <br>
* Module
* Revealing Module Pattern
* Singleton
* Factory
* Observer
* Mediator
* State
