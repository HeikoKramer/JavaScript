# weatherJS

**NOTE:** I have excluded the weather.js file from this repo as it contains my private API key. <br>
Use the [weather_example.js](https://github.com/HeikoKramer/webDev/blob/main/js_tutorials/API_Projects/weatherjs/weather_example.js) file, rename it and add your API key, if you want to build this project. <br>
