## The DOM
**DOM** stands for **DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL**. What it is: <br>
* Tree of nodes/elements created by the browser
* JavaScript can be used to read/write/manipulate the DOM
* Object oriented representation

![The DOM](/images/the_dom.png)

The browser gives us a **window object** and inside that, we have the **document object**. <br>
The **document object** represents the loaded document or web-page. <br>
The **root element** underneath it represents the **html tag**. <br>
**head** and **body** element represent the appropriate tags within the html file. <br>
All the elements form the html have their representatives in the DOM. <br>
We can manipulate all that stuff pretty easily with JavaScript. <br>
