# HTML Notes

## Tag Syntax
A tag is an element surrounded in angle brackets. <br>
The most HTML elements, like a **header** or a **paragraph**, have a **start & end tag**. <br>

```html
<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website</p>
```

Some tags, like the **line break** close themselves (remnant of XHTML). <br>
Those are called **self closing tags**. <br>

```html
<br>      <!-- Valid in HTML5 -->
<br / >   <!-- Valid in HTML5 & XHTML -->
```

## Doctype & Basic Layout
The **doctype** declaration must be the first thing in your HTML document. <br>
It tells the browser what type of document it is. <br>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
